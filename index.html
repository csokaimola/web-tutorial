<h1 id="cim" style="color: red;">Data Analysis: Patterns, Prediction and Causality <br>
<i> <font size="6"> A graduate textbook for Business, Economics and Policy </font> </i></h1>
<p>Data Analysis: Exploration, Patterns, Prediction and Causality is a textbook aimed primarily at business, applied economics and public policy students. It may be taught at MBA, MA Economics (non-PhD track), MSc in Business Economics/Management, MA in Public Policy, PhD in Management and comparable programs. It also a natural fit in Business Analytics graduate programs. </p>
<h2>I. Data Exploration</h2>
<p class="szemely">Real data needs cleaning and restructuring before it can be analyzed. The decisions during that process may have far-reaching consequences for the results of the analysis. Yet they are rarely discussed in standard statistics, econometrics and machine learning texts. Even after extensive cleaning the data used in the analysis is typically different from the ideal dataset that would serve the analysis best. Analysts need to have a thorough understanding of those differences to interpret their results in appropriate ways. The examples used in our course help students acquire the tools of data management and data cleaning and track the consequences of data cleaning on the results of their analysis. Furthermore, similar issues are addressed when analysts collect their own data or influence data collection in some ways.
<ol>
  <li>Origins of data (data table, data quality, survey, scraping, sampling, ethics)</li>
  <li>Preparing data for analysis (tidy data, source of variation, variable types, missing data, data cleaning)</li>
  <li>Exploratory data analysis (probability, distributions, extreme values, summary stats, layers of data visualization)</li>
  <li>Comparison and correlation (conditional probability, conditional distribution, conditional expectation, visual comparisons, correlation, good graphs and tables)</li>
  <li>Generalizing from a dataset (repeated samples, confidence interval, standard error estimation via bootstrap and formula, external validity)</li>
  <li>Testing hypotheses (null and alternative hypotheses, t-test, false positives / false negatives, p-value, testing multiple hypotheses)</li>
</ol>

<h2>II. Patterns: regression analysis</h2>
<p class="szemely">Uncovering patterns in the data can be an important goal in itself, and it is the prerequisite to establishing cause and effect and carrying out predictions. The course starts with simple regression analysis, the method that compares expected y for different values of x to learn the patterns of association between the two variables. It discusses nonparametric regressions and focuses on the linear regression. It builds on simple linear regression and goes on to enriching it with nonlinear functional forms, generalizing from a particular dataset to other data it represents, adding more explanatory variables, etc. The course also covers regression analysis for time series data, panel data, binary dependent variables, as well as nonlinear models such as logit and probit. Understanding the intuition behind the methods, their applicability in various situations, and the correct interpretation of their results are the constant focus of the course.</p>
<h2>III. Prediction</h2>
<p class="szemely">Data analysis in business and policy applications is often aimed at prediction. The course introduces tools to evaluate predictions, such as loss functions or the Brier score. It emphasizes the importance of out-of-sample prediction, the role of stationarity, the dangers of overfitting and the use of training and testing samples and cross-validation. It presents and compares the most important predictive models that may be useful in various situations such as time series regressions, classification tools and tree-based machine learning methods. </p>
<h2>IV. Causality: learning the effects of interventions</h2>
<p class="szemely">Decisions in business and policy are often centered on specific interventions, such as changing monetary policy, modifying health care financing, changing the price or other attributes of products, or changing the media mix in marketing. Learning the effects of such interventions is an important purpose of data analysis. The course incorporates the basic concepts and methods used by program evaluation (the framework of potential outcomes, the benefits of randomized assignment, etc.). It also covers related methods used in business, such as A/B testing. </p>
